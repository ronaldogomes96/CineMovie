# CineMovie

This project consists of showing the films that are in the cinema, along with their release date information, average public rating, poster, in addition to the description of the film.

All this information is brought from [The Movie Database API (TMDb)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing). The request was made using alamofire and uploading images with Kingfisher.

The movie listing screens are fully paginated, in addition to having the option to bookmark and view the information of the favorites afterwards without the need for an internet connection. Persistence was done with Core Data
